# Master-Real

In order to get the data used for the master thesis the program download_cdf.py must be run with the desired date span. 
This makes sure the necessary .cdf files is downloaded from ESA's website.

Now run the project.py program in order to convert the .cdf files to binary feather files. 

The main results plots are now ready to be produced by the plotter_from_dst_Final.py. 

Good luck!
